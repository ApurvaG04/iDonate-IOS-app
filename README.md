# iDonate IOS App

## Background and motivation: 
This project is aimed at addressing the problem of food waste and finding solutions to reduce the amount of food waste in our local communities. Our application is attempting to address how to make the concept of food donation much simpler and more efficient, being able to manage inventory, including a review system for each donation location, and being able to create delicious foods based on the user input without having the struggles of finding a recipe that uses the foods inputted.

### Summary: 
Our group is creating an application where we allow the user to find a place where they can donate food to reduce the amount of food waste, being able to view the inventory of food at a particular location, incorporating a review system for each particular donation location, and being able to search and create delicious foods using the foods that were inputted by the user.

## Features:
1. Food Inventory and Management - Manages the inventory of food from the different locations, the user will be able to donate or receive the food from that location, and allows the user to take note of the inventory.

2. Food Donating List and Address of Location - A list of foods that would like to be donated at a particular location and shows the user where they can donate the food.

3. Food Donation Locations and Review of Location - Creating a list of food donating places and creating a review for “each” location (API). 

4. Food Recommendations - Based on the foods that the user inputs, the algorithm will display food recommendations that you can create from the food that the user inputs.
